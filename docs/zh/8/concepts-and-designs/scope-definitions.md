Calculate the metrics data of the dependency between one endpoint and the other endpoint. 
This relation is hard to detect, also depends on tracing lib to propagate the prev endpoint. 
So `EndpointRelation` scope aggregation effects only in service under tracing by SkyWalking native agents, 
including auto instrument agents(like Java, .NET), OpenCensus SkyWalking exporter implementation or others propagate tracing context in SkyWalking spec.
